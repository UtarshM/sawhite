## Style Guidelines:

- Clean, bright white background (#FFFFFF) to create a professional, spacious feel, per user request.
- Use a deep shade of purple (#5851DB). The saturation suggests forward motion; the purple tone speaks of learning.
- Very light purple background (#F1F0FD). Close to white, but a visual relative of the primary color.
- Golden orange (#FFAC4B) to complement the purple, signaling important details.
- 'Space Grotesk', a geometric sans-serif for a modern tech-focused design; use 'Inter' for the body text.
- Use a consistent set of outline icons in the accent color to represent different sections and features.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout with sufficient spacing for easy readability.
